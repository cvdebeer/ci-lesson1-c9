# My first Cloud9 project

Welcome!

In this project we created html and css files.
I created all the pages with links to wikipedia pages and pictures of the different platforms used in development.
I found it quite challenging to get the visuals to line up as it seemed that the 4th div kept pulling everything scew.
I went back to check the source code from the initial video to see if I could resolve this from the css on there.

I use git to create a repository of my files and pushed it up to Github for viewing.

Enjoy
